        <h1>Hello, Reader!</h1>
        <p>This is going to be a webpage about me, Jo-Yul!</p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Hobbies</h1>
        <p2>My favourite hobbies are to play the violin, play video games, 
            chat online, and most importantly, 
            have fun with things. </p2>
        <br><br>
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Family: My Fraternal Twin, Caleb</h1>
        <div>No picture, he didn't want his face to be shown. I respect his decision.</div>
        <p>He just loves to pull pranks on me, but he always fails to do so because of his laziness and his reclklessness...
        although I do call him a "pet" sometimes as a joke, all is well in the end. 
        He likes to play video games... too much, I think. I have tried multiple times to get him to study instead of play video games...
        I cannot stop him from doing his shenanagians, though. Simply put, a nice guy to his friends but not a nice guy to his younger fraternal twin.
        I don't blame him for "bullying" me. We are FRATERNAL twins, after all.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Hobbies: Violin</h1>
        <img src="violin.jpeg" id="idImageOne" width=200>
        <p>I have been playing the violin for almost 5 years now, and still counting! I love orchestral music pieces, specifically the violin and the cello
         because my fraternal twin plays the cello. I have met a lot of people during my years in school orchestra, and I am fond with some of them today. 
         I don't play in any school orchestras anymore, but I play at home to have fun.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Hobbies: Video Games & Speedrunning</h1>
        <img src="controller.jpeg" id="idImageTwo" width=200>
        <p>I do play video games (yes, I have a life), but I also speedrun games! Now, don't take me for famous Minecraft speedrunner "Dream", 
            because I don't speedrun Minecraft. Instead, I opt for less popular games inside ROBLOX, a game platform. When I say that "I'm playing video games", 
            I mean that I'm either playing with friends for fun, or I'm speedrunning games to claim the #1 spot on the leaderboards.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Hobbies: Chatting Online</h1>
        <p>I think that students should have a decent explanation of what Discord is...</p>
        <p>I use the chatting app called Discord, a popular app where you can meet new friends. Of course, there are downsides, but I always try to evade them.
            I also teach people how to further develop their minds in one of many ROBLOX games, and I use Discord to communicate to them. It's always fun
            teaching others.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Hobbies: Studying?</h1>
        <p>When I'm not speedrunning, I like to study, as weird and confusing as it sounds. Yes, I like to learn new things about every subject that I am in, 
            because I find them interesting. It is always a challenge to keep that knowledge, but I enjoy testing myself to my limits to see where I am. 
            Of course, I may not like studying at times, as I am just a fourteen-year-old. Despite this, I always try to do my best at things!
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Gratitudes</h1>
        <p>Thanks for reading through this and seeing what I like to do best! I appreciate your time spent reading this, and I hope that you understand
            more about me as a person. This page is nothing to brag about, but it is my work, and I have spent time to build this and am proud of it.
            Again, thanks for reading!
        </p>
